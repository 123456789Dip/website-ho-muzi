    <h1> k xa mero vai raja</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Maya</strong> — an 18-year-old learner who’s starting a new journey in technology and creativity.  
This is my first website, and it’s just the beginning of something amazing.  
I’m learning to build websites, create apps, and grow my skills step by step every single day. 🚀</p>
<p>2. Inspirational (for personal growth or motivation)
At 18, I’ve decided to restart my life with energy, focus, and purpose.  
This website represents my new beginning — a space where I’ll share my learning, progress, and ideas.  
Every line of code is a small step toward my dream of freedom, independence, and success. 🌱
